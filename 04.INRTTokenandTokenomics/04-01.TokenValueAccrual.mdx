As illustrated below, the Inertia ecosystem comprises Lending and LST Liquidity, along with the nINIT-INIT pool external to Inertia. There are various revenue models from each liquidity and activity source, which collectively contribute to the continuous growth of the INRT token's value. Detailed explanations for each item are as follows:

- **Gross Yield**: This is the revenue income obtained by converting a portion of idle lending liquidity into yield generating assets. This revenue is 100% utilized for INRT buyback, directly contributing to the value of INRT.
- **nINIT Yield Farming APR**: This is the staking income from users who choose INRT yield farming by holding nINIT. A portion of this revenue is used for INRT buyback.
- **Money Market Fee**: This is the protocol fee revenue generated from lending market interests. It constitutes 10% of the total borrow interest, with part of this revenue being used for INRT buyback.
- **LST Fee**: This is the revenue generated from staking yields from LST. A portion of this will be used for INRT buyback. The potential fee revenues from LST are as follows: 1) Fees on INIT rewards given to users who choose to receive INIT staking rewards with sINIT 2) Fees on INIT staking rewards if users choose to receive INRT as a reward for holding nINIT, 3) Fees on yields generated from converting assets into LST through Modular Lending.
- **Protocol-Owned Liquidity Swap Fee**: This is the swap fee revenue from the protocol-owned liquidity within the nINIT-INIT pool. This POL revenue is 100% utilized for INRT buyback.
