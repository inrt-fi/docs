title: "INRT Token and Tokenomics"
---

**INRT** is Inertia’s native token, integral to both governance and the incentive structure of the protocol. The tokenomics are aligned to **promote lending activity and share in the platform’s success**:

- **Governance and Utility**: INRT holders govern the Inertia protocol, voting on important parameters like interest rate models, collateral factors, and new asset listings. This ensures the community of lenders and borrowers has a say in risk management and future development. INRT may also be used for fee discounts or priority access to new features, further embedding it into the user experience.
- **Lending Incentives**: A core function of INRT is to **incentivize participation** in the lending markets. A portion of INRT’s supply is allocated as rewards for users who lend or stake through the platform (as described in the Farming Supercharger program). By issuing INRT to active users, Inertia bootstraps liquidity and ensures there is ample supply of assets for borrowers. This incentive aligns with the protocol’s growth: the more lending volume and collateral locked in Inertia, the more users can potentially earn INRT, creating a positive feedback loop for adoption.
- **Actual Yield Distribution**: Unlike purely inflationary reward tokens, INRT’s value is meant to be underpinned by true yield generated by the protocol. Inertia earns revenue from various sources: interest payments from borrowers, a share of the staking/restaking rewards (if the protocol takes a small cut when facilitating LST/LRT yields), and profits from deploying idle liquidity. A portion of these revenues can be funneled back to INRT holders, either through **buyback-and-burn mechanisms**, dividends to those who stake or lock INRT, or funding continued rewards. This means as lending activity grows and the protocol earns more, INRT holders directly benefit from that value accrual. The design incentivizes long-term holding of INRT, as the token represents a stake in the success of the lending platform.
- **Value Accrual Mechanisms**: For sustained value, Inertia’s tokenomics are structured so that INRT demand increases with platform usage. For example, governance decisions might mandate using a portion of interest income to market-buy INRT from the open market (increasing demand) or require borrowers to pay fees in INRT. Such mechanisms tie the token’s fate to the platform’s **revenue streams**, helping to stabilize and raise INRT’s price as Inertia becomes more widely used. By emphasizing revenue-sharing and limiting unchecked token emission, Inertia aligns INRT with the **“real yield” trend** in DeFi, where protocol tokens derive value from cash flows back to token holders.
