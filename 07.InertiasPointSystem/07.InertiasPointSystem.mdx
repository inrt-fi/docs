title: "Inertiaâ€™s Point System"
---

Prior to TGE, Inertia will initiate a Points System that is purposed to gather accessibility and usability of the protocol. We look to reward users who partner with Inertia in its long term success. The Points System will run until before the TGE.

Below is a rough multiplier schedule of how points will be distributed to users, depending on utilization and time.
