title: "Initia’s VIP Rewards"
---

**Initia’s VIP Rewards**: Inertia is uniquely positioned as a core protocol in the Initia universe that allows significant advantages in attracting more INIT into the ecosystem. This advantage gives Inertia increased concentration of INIT, which further amplifies opportunities for the user to capture a larger share of Initia’s VIP rewards for example – which remains one of the ecosystem’s most critical features.

**The result is a self-reinforcing flywheel**:

1. More INIT supplied to Inertia
2. Higher VIP allocations secured
3. Greater reward distribution to Inertia users

This positive feedback loop allows Inertia users to receive meaningfully higher incentives compared to other L2s within the Initia Ecosystem.
