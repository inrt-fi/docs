- **Earn Interest \+ Staking Yields**: Lenders earn interest paid by borrowers on assets they deposit. If those deposits are LSTs or LRTs, lenders **continue earning** **staking/restaking** rewards on top of the normal interest. This dual income stream significantly boosts overall returns compared to traditional lending platforms. For example, depositing an LST like staked TIA yields borrower interest and the native TIA staking yield simultaneously.
- **Enhanced APY via Yield Management**: Thanks to Inertia’s idle asset yield strategies, lenders enjoy higher APYs. Any idle capital they deposit (such as unused stablecoins) is deployed into external yield farms or interest-bearing protocols to generate extra revenue​. These earnings are passed back to depositors, augmenting their base interest. Lenders effectively earn augmented **yield** from multiple sources, not just borrowing demand.
- **Incentives in INRT**: Inertia rewards active lenders with **INRT tokens** as part of its growth incentives. The protocol’s **Farming Supercharger** further boosts rewards for those who deposit LSTs and LRTs, granting higher INRT payout rates than standard pools​. This incentivizes providing the more valuable collateral (like restaked tokens) and compensates lenders with an additional yield in the form of the platform’s native token.
- **Diversified Collateral and Lower Risk**: Because Inertia aggregates assets from various chains, lenders can supply a diverse range of tokens. This diversification, combined with the protocol’s risk management, can lead to more **stable interest rates** and lower default risk. Inertia’s modular design also means even if one asset or chain is volatile, the overall lending pool remains robust, protecting lenders’ funds.
