**Swap**

Inertia plans to integrate key Initia DEXs (or DEX aggregators) within the service to allow users to execute necessary swaps as a built-in feature. Users can choose to utilize the DEX when it is more advantageous in minting or redeeming their LRTs.

**LP Pool**

Inertia will maintain INRT pools with rewards that are given to users who contribute to the liquidity pools itself. The primary pools eligible for INRT rewards are listed below:

- **INRT-INIT Pool**: Important for the price stability and appreciation of INRT.
- **nINIT-INIT Pool**: Crucial for the pegging stability of LST.

#### Governance

As a governance token, INRT holders can participate in various decision-making processes essential for operating the Inertia platform. Decisions that can be made through governance polls include:

- Determining the utilization of assets accumulated in the treasury.
- Setting protocol parameters (e.g., Fee Rate, Max LTV, Liquidation Penalty).
- Integrating new tokens into the lending protocol.
