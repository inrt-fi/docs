title: "Inertia as a LST/LRT Platform"

**Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)** and **Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)** are at the heart of Inertia’s value proposition, serving as complementary elements that supercharge the lending protocol:

- **Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)** represent ownership of staked assets that remain liquid and transferrable​. When users stake an asset, they receive an LST in return, which **accrues staking rewards** and can simultaneously be used in DeFi – for instance, as collateral for a loan​. This allows stakers to **earn rewards and borrow** at the same time, effectively making staked assets doubly productive.
- **Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRTs)** extend this concept by allowing already-staked assets (or LSTs) to be **restaked** on additional protocols for extra yield​. Platforms like EigenLayer issue LRTs to users who restake their tokens to secure other networks. An LRT thus represents a restaked asset that also retains the ability to earn **additional rewards on top of normal staking**​. Importantly, LRTs are designed to be used in DeFi just like LSTs – users can trade, lend, or borrow them to amplify returns​

In Inertia’s lending market, LSTs and LRTs from major ecosystems can be supplied and used as collateral, blurring the line between staking and lending. For example, a user holding staked INIT can deposit it into Inertia to earn interest from borrowers while still receiving INIT staking rewards in the background.
