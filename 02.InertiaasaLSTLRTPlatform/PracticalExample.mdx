---

- A user seeking to actively farm or provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges can stake INIT and receive **nINIT**, utilizing it in DeFi farming pools to generate INRT tokens.
- Conversely, another user focused on accumulating staking rewards while accessing liquidity via borrowing can stake INIT, receive **sINIT**, deposit it as collateral in the lending market, borrow stablecoins, and maintain continuous staking yield growth.

This dual-token approach distinctly separates users' financial goals, clearly defining the utility of each token:

- **nINIT** for liquidity and active farming participation.
- **sINIT** for staking reward accrual and leveraged borrowing positions.

**Farming** Inertia offers a range of LSDFi features that enable users to farm various forms of yield using nINIT. Initially, Inertia supports a farming feature where users can deposit nINIT to earn additional INRT rewards, with additional engaging features planned for the future.

A portion of the total INRT supply is allocated for nINIT farming rewards. nINIT holders can deposit their nINIT in Inertia to receive INRT farming rewards.

The farming feature offers higher rewards compared to simply holding nINIT and choosing INRT rewards. However, users who deposit nINIT for farming will need to go through a 2-week redemption period to retrieve their nINIT.

**Farming Supercharger Feature** INRT holders can maximize the rewards obtained through nINIT by staking their INRT in the Farming Supercharger feature. Inertia allows users to increase their farming APR by staking larger amounts of INRT for longer periods. This feature helps control the INRT circulation and aims to establish long-term utility for INRT.
