title: "Inertia as a Yield Management Strategy Platform"
---

As previously mentioned, Inertia offers an all-in-one DeFi protocol for all things within the Initia ecosystem. In continuation of other lending or LST/LRT protocols, Inertia has several differentiating factors:

- Inertia actively manages assets that generate true yield, a functionality referred to as Yield Management Strategy. Through this feature, Inertia aims to generate true yield from lending protocol assets and use these earnings for INRT buybacks.
- Inertia enhances user experience by allowing users to easily leverage positions with verified yielding assets such as LSTs and LRTs, thereby improving usability and engagement.
